I would like to specialize in robotics, so I'm really glad i can take this capstone. I like to spend my free time in the open and try to discover as much a possible of the city of Seattle and its surroundings in the short time I am here.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Winfried Schuffert**  \r\n![Winfried](https://github.com/s9wischu/Botinator/blob/master/images/blog01_w.jpg)  \r\nI'm a computer science student from Saarland University, Germany.\r\nCurrently I'm doing some quarter abroad to gather new experience in both professional and private live.\r\nMy interests are Software engineering flavoured with a spicy pinch of electrical engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Top three project ideas\r\n1. Smart robotic notebook that gathers data for a scientist on request.\r\n1. Robot that can detect and preferably remove obstacles objects that could pose a safety hazard to blind people.\r\n1. Robot that autonomously scans an area and bulid a 3D model of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current activities (last step of Lab 2)\r\nRobot (Turtlebot) that randomly roam around its environment. Everytime the robot bumbs against an obstacle, it makes one step back, changes the direction and start again moving forward.  \r\n![](https://github.com/s9wischu/Botinator/blob/master/images/blog01_roomba.png)  \r\nLeft window: 3D-simulator with five boxes and the Robot (black circle) in the middle.  \r\nRigth window: log-messages to check the behaviour of the robot.
