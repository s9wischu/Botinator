I would like to specialize in robotics, so I'm really glad i can take this capstone. I like to spend my free time in the open and try to discover as much a possible of the city of Seattle and its surroundings in the short time I am here.\r\n\r\nWinfried Schuffert\r\n![w](https://github.com/s9wischu/Botinator/blob/master/images/blog01_w.jpg)\r\nI'm a computer science student from Saarland University, Germany.\r\nCurrently I'm doing some quarter abroad to gather new experience in both professional and private live.\r\nMy interests are Software engineering flavoured with a spicy pinch of electrical engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Top three project ideas\r\n1. Smart robotic notebook that gathers data for a scientist on request.\r\n1. Robot that can detect and preferably remove obstacles objects that could pose a safety hazard to blind people.\r\n1. Robot that autonomously scans an area and bulid a 3D model of it.\r\n\r\n### Current activities (last step of Lab 2)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
